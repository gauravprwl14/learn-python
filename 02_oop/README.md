# Python Fundamentals

This section covers Python fundamentals from basic to advanced concepts.

## Basic Concepts (Junior Level)

Located in `/basic` directory:

### 1. Introduction

- Python setup and environment
- Basic syntax and variables
- Simple I/O operations

### 2. Data Types

- Numbers, strings, and booleans
- Basic collections
- Type conversions

### 3. Control Flow

- If statements
- Loops
- Basic error handling

## Advanced Concepts (Tech Lead Level)

Located in `/advanced` directory:

### 1. Memory Management

- Python's memory model
- Reference counting
- Garbage collection internals
